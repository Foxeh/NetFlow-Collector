    Flags (6x1 bit): The flags represent additional information:
    URG: if this flag is set to 1 the packet must be processed urgently
    ACK: if this flag is set to 1 the packet is an acknowledgement.
    PSH (PUSH): if this flag is set to 1 the packet operates according to the PUSH method.
    RST: if this flag is set to 1 the connection is reset.
    SYN: The TCP SYN flag indicates a request to establish a connection.
    FIN: if this flag is set to 1 the connection is interrupted.
